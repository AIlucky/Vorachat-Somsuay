# NFS \[111,2049]

## Quick Intro

* Developed in 1984 by Sun Microsystem and similar to SMB because it allows access to files over a network.
* Common ports used by NFS are **port 111 and 2049 tcp/udp**
* It is a client/server system that allows users to access files across a network and treat them as if they resided in a local file directory.

## Identifying if NFS is in use

```
rpcinfo -p <ip>

# If you get 111 and 2049 listed , shares are enable and we can mount themShow all mounts
```

* if nfs is available, use **showmount** to view available mounting points

```
showmount -e $ip
```

## Mount a NFS share

* you can then mount the file system with the **mount** command and interact with remote system
* first create the directory for mounting -

```
mkdir /mnt/nfs
```

```
mount -t nfs $ip:/share /mnt/nfsUnmounting the shares umount -f -l /mnt/nfs
# -f – Force unmount (in case of an unreachable NFS system). (Requires kernel 2.1.116 or later.)
# -l – Lazy unmount. Detach the filesystem from the filesystem hierarchy now, and cleanup all references to the filesystem as soon as it is not busy anymore. (Requires kernel 2.4.11 or later.)
```
