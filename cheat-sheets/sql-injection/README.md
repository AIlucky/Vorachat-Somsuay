## Types of Databases

Databases, in general, are categorized into `Relational Databases` and `Non-Relational Databases`. Only Relational Databases utilize SQL, while Non-Relational databases utilize a variety of methods for communications.

### Relational Databases

* Most common type of database
* Tables in a relational database are associated with keys
* These tables, also called entities, are all related to each other
* Many companies are switching to the RDBMS concept
* Many types of databases now implement the RDBMS concept
  * Microsoft Access, MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle, PostgreSQL, etc.

### Non-relational Databases

`NoSQL` database does not use tables, rows, and columns or prime keys, relationships, or schemas.

* NoSQL database stores data using various storage models, depending on the type of data stored
* NoSQL databases are very scalable and flexible
* NoSQL database would be the best choice for storing datasets that are not very well defined
* There are four common storage models for NoSQL databases
  * Key-Value
  * Document-Based
  * Wide-Column
  * Graph
