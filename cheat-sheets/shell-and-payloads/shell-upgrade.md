1. `Ctrl-Z` backgrounding the shell process.
2. `stty -a` checking the number of rows and columns in the host terminal.
3. `stty raw -echo` setting terminal settings like new line, break characters etc.
4. `fg + ENTER` returning to the shell.
5. `reset`, `export SHELL=bash`, `export TERM=xterm-256color` declaring environment variables to be able to use cllear etc. and colors.
6. `stty rows <num> columns <cols>` setting the terminal rows and columns based on the host configuration.
